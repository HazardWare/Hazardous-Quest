# Hazardous Quest
Hazardous Quest is a top-down RPG game inspired by retro titles such as [The Legend of Zelda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda_(video_game))

The game functions with a semi-linear progression system where you play as a princess in a free-roam hub with different areas to visit and shop at. Go dungeon to dungeon and collect items to help you in your crusade to save the prince (your brother)!
